The quadprog\+\_\+solve() function implements the algorithm of Goldfarb and Idnani for the solution of a (convex) Quadratic Programming problem by means of an active-\/set dual method.

The problem is in the form\+:

min 0.\+5 $\ast$ x G x + g0 x s.\+t. C\+E$^\wedge$T x + ce0 = 0 C\+I$^\wedge$T x + ci0 $>$= 0

The matrix and vectors dimensions are as follows\+: G\+: n $\ast$ n g0\+: n

CE\+: n $\ast$ p ce0\+: p

CI\+: n $\ast$ m ci0\+: m

x\+: n

The function will return the cost of the solution written in the x vector or std\+::numeric\+\_\+limits\+::infinity() if the problem is infeasible. In the latter case the value of the x vector is not correct.

Notes\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item pay attention in setting up the vectors ce0 and ci0. If the constraints of your problem are specified in the form A$^\wedge$T x = b and C$^\wedge$T x $>$= d, then you should set ce0 = -\/b and ci0 = -\/d.
\item The matrices have column dimension equal to M\+A\+T\+R\+I\+X\+\_\+\+D\+IM, a constant set to 20 in this file (by means of a \#define macro). If the matrices are bigger than 20 x 20 the limit could be increased by means of a -\/\+D\+M\+A\+T\+R\+I\+X\+\_\+\+D\+IM=n on the compiler command line.
\item The matrix G is modified within the function since it is used to compute the G = L$^\wedge$T L cholesky factorization for further computations inside the function. If you need the original matrix G you should make a copy of it and pass the copy to the function.
