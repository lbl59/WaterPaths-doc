\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{classRelocation}{Relocation}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This subclass of \mbox{\hyperlink{classWaterSource}{Water\+Source}} represents a relocation (reallocation) of water between utilities. This subclass does not have any water directly routed through it. Continuity equations therefore do not apply to it. It can only change allocated fractions in the reservoir/water source it is assigned to. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
