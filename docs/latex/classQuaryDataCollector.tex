The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classQuaryDataCollector}{Quary\+Data\+Collector}}} class is a subclass of the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classReservoirDataCollector}{Reservoir\+Data\+Collector}}} class, which in turn is a subclass of the main {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDataCollector}{Data\+Collector}}} class. It implements the data collection of quarry objects. F\+I\+X\+ME\+: Needs to be renamed to {\ttfamily Quarry\+Data\+Collector}.
